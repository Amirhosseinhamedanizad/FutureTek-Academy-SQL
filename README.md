# FutureTek-Academy-SQL
SQL-Data Analytics Course

We will perform data analysis using SQL, utilizing the tables provided by a DVD rental Database.

actor (actor_id, first_name, last_name)

film (film_id, title, description, release_year,language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate,replacement_cost, rating)

film_actor(film_id, actor_id)

customer(customer_id, first_name, last_name, address_id)

payment(payment_id, customer_id, amount, date)

address(address_id, street, city_id, phone)

rental(rental_id, rental_date, customer_id, inventory_id)

inventory(inventory_id, film_id, store_id)

I will showcase various SQL techniques including self join, natural join, left and right outer join, subqueries, union, intersect, difference, exists, not exists, membership operators (in, not in), group by, order by, aggregate functions, rollup, regular expressions, and more. Let's begin the exciting journey.
